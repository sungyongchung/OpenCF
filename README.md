**OpenCF** benchmark is an open-source evaluation framework for car-following models.

It provides a standardized testbed to benchmark car-following models against real-world data derived from high-fidelity onboard sensors of Waymo vehicles.

## 📂 Dataset Access

This benchmark utilizes a massive repository of over **32,500** car-following pairs (approx. **84.5** hours of driving) collected from Waymo vehicles.

* **Training Data (`train.csv`):** [**DOWNLOAD HERE (Google Drive)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13I8crm9Dm8QQH4Hmz8G6yHuuabRmnkut/view?usp=share_link) *(Currently restricted: Access will be open to the public soon!)*
    * *Contains **29,559** processed pairs for model calibration/training.*
    * *Total Volume: **2.79 million+** time steps (approx. **76.7** hours).*
    * *You may use this data to train your model, but it is not required for evaluation.*
* **Test Input (`benchmark_data/test_input.csv`):** Included in this repo.
    * *Contains **3,000** held-out pairs for the leaderboard.*
    * *Total Duration: Approx. **7.8** hours of evaluation scenarios.*
    * *Leader: The complete trajectory is provided for the entire duration.*
    * *Follower: Only the first 2.9s of history is provided. Your model must predict the follower's behavior from t=3.0s onwards.*

### ⚠️ A Note on Data Processing
To maintain the integrity of the benchmark and prevent overfitting to specific filtering criteria, **we do not disclose the exact logic used to extract car-following pairs from the raw Waymo data.**

However, please note:
1.  **Identical Processing:** The Training Set and Test Set were generated using the **exact same** filtering, extraction, and smoothing pipeline.
2.  **Consistency:** Models trained on the provided `train.csv` will encounter a statistically similar distribution in the test set.

## 🏆 How to Participate

We use an automated **Evaluation-as-a-Service** workflow. You do not need to run the evaluation scripts yourself; GitHub Actions will do it for you.

### 1. Prepare Your Model
1.  Download `benchmark_data/test_input.csv`.
2.  Run your model to generate trajectories for all pairs.
3.  **Format:** Your output CSV must strictly follow the format below.
    * **⚠️ FILE SIZE LIMIT:** To keep file sizes under 100MB (GitHub limit), your submission **MUST ONLY contain predictions starting from `t=3.0s`**.
    * **DO NOT** include the history (0.0s - 2.9s) in your submission file.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CF_pair_id` | ID matching the test set |
| `sample_id` | `0` for deterministic, `0` to `5` for stochastic (Max 6 samples) |
| `Time` | Time in seconds (**Must start at 3.0**, aligning with ground truth steps) |
| `follower_dist` | Longitudinal position (meters) |
| `follower_speed` | Speed (m/s) |
| `follower_acceleration`| Acceleration (m/s²) |

*See `benchmark_data/submission_template.csv`.*

### 2. Submit Your Results
1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Add your files:** Place your results CSV file into the `submissions/` folder.
    * *Naming convention: `ModelName.csv`.*
    * **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** **Do not modify any other files** in the repository (e.g., scripts, workflows, or existing submissions).
    * *Pull Requests that modify system files or delete other users' models will be automatically flagged and may be rejected.*
3.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of this repository.

### 3. (Optional) Submit Model Metadata
To display details about your model on the leaderboard (Description, Calibration, Papers), submit a JSON file with the **same filename** as your CSV.

*Format: `submissions/MyModel.json`*
```json
{
    "description": "A brief description of your model.",
    "assumptions": "List key assumptions (e.g., constant reaction time).",
    "calibration": "Details on how it was calibrated.",
    "paper_link": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/](https://arxiv.org/abs/)..."
}
```

### 4. Automated Evaluation
* Once your PR is opened, our **Automated Judge** (GitHub Actions) will run immediately.
* It will evaluate your submission against the hidden Ground Truth.
* **Check the PR comments:** The bot will post your scores (RMSE, Collision Rate, etc.) and Pass/Fail status.
* If your submission is valid, we will merge it, and you will appear on the **Leaderboard Website**.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate models on three dimensions:

### 1. Transition Probability Analysis
We compare the **Geometric Mean Transition Probability** of your generated trajectories against the Ground Truth using a **Mann-Whitney U Test**.
* **PASS:** p-value > 0.05 (Your model's behavior is statistically indistinguishable from the Ground Truth).
* **FAIL:** p-value < 0.05.

### 2. One-Step Prediction (Short-term)
Measures accuracy at exactly `t = 3.0s` (the first predicted step). We calculate the average state (spacing, speed, and acceleration) across all submitted samples (K) before computing the error.
* **RMSE (s):** Root Mean Square Error of Spacing.
* **RMSE (v):** Root Mean Square Error of Speed.
* **RMSE (a):** Root Mean Square Error of Acceleration.

### 3. Open-Loop Prediction (Long-term)
Measures consistency over the full trajectory horizon.
* **minADE:** Minimum Average Displacement Error (over K samples).
* **minFDE:** Minimum Final Displacement Error (at the last timestep over K samples).
* **Collision Rate:** Percentage of test pairs where the follower collides with the leader (`follower_dist > leader_dist`).
